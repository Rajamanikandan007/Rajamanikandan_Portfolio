                    My name is Rajamanikandan, and I am a MERN Stack Developer,
                    UI/UX Enthusiast, and IoT Innovator with a passion for
                    creating modern, user-friendly, and scalable web
                    applications. I specialize in both front-end and back-end
                    development, ensuring seamless functionality and visually
                    appealing designs.

                    With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
                    Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I have worked on various
                    projects that solve real-world problems. One of my most
                    notable projects is the Smart Fire Detector and Alert
                    System, which combines image processing and IoT to enhance
                    fire safety measures. Additionally, I am working on an
                    IoT-based Smart Irrigation System, leveraging automation to
                    optimize water usage in agriculture.

                    Android IoT Development. These experiences have given me
                    exposure to modern technologies, industry best practices,
                    and cross-functional collaboration.

                    teamwork, and decision-making skillsâ€”qualities that I bring
                    into my professional career. My enthusiasm for gaming also

                    I thrive on continuous learning, innovation, and pushing
